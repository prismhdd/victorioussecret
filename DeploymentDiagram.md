> With this setup the hardware and software components can be separated into the System and the Client.  For the     client all that is required hardware wise is a computer that is able to execute the Sun Java 1.5 JRE and a web browser.   The client also needs to have an Internet connection in order to communicate with the System.  As for the software, the client needs to be running either Linux, Windows, or a Mac and for applications the Sun Java 1.5 JRE and a compatible web browser, i.e. Firefox or Internet Explorer are required.


> The System is more complex in the sense of software, however, the hardware is very similar to the client.  All that is required is a computer that is compatible with the software applications that we will be using and an Internet connection.  The software will be running on the Linux operating system and will consist of a web server, scripting engine, and a database.  For the web server Apache 2.2.x will be used because it is a high performance modular web server that easily integrates with the selected scripting langauge and operating system.  PHP will be used as the server side scripting language because it works well with Apache and Linux.  In addition it is a fairly quick language to learn allowing for beginners to master it in a relatively short time and it has object oriented aspects making it rival bigger languages such as Java and C++.  To aid in setting up the communication with the database PHP will use a database abstraction layer known as Doctrine, commonly referred to as an ORM (object relational mapper).  The reason for using an ORM are because it saves us a lot of effort writing SQL queries, it provides easy implementations for searching and paginating data, and lastly it will save a lot of time which is important when working on a time constrained project.  Lastly for the database PostgreSQL will be used because it is a free and open source database that some of the group members have siginificant experience with.  It is also favored by the Computer Science department.
