[Note:Elaborate on why/what they offer/don't offer]
  * Last.fm - Offers a lot of information on artist in a user-editable format (a la Wikipedia), but does not offer any alert information
  * Pandora - Good for creating a streaming playlist of similar artists based on user input, and to a lesser extent than Last.fm, information on the artists. Also lacks any alert feature
  * Artist Fan Clubs - Often offer email alerts with general artist information, e.g. new albums, concerts, etc. Require the user to manually sign up at each artists website.
