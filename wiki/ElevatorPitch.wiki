#summary Elevator Pitch

We plan on developing a web-app that allows a user to better follow releases from their favorite artists.  After scanning a users music library, our solution will compare upcoming releases to the current library and inform the user of potentially interesting albums. Integration with internet music websites such as Pandora or Last.fm could increase the amount of artist information available.  Keeping the system as user-friendly as possible is a high priority in order increase usability.  

First-draft high level overview.
