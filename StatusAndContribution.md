# Project Inception #
## Project Status Report ##
  * We have set up a project on Google Code located at http://code.google.com/p/victorioussecret.
  * Completed Project Inception
  * Issues Resolved
    * A fellow classmate brought up the issue of how to deal with music which had corrupted/incorrect ID3 tags, and after some research we discovered that legally purchased music will have the correct embedded ID3 tags - solved by Woojoon
  * Started the Elaboration phase
  * Set up development environment to start programming the project
  * One of our risks was having to rely on a third party for updated artist/album information, in order to mitigate this risks we will use different sources for information
