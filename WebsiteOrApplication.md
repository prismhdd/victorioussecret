# Website #
Web application developed in PHP
## Pros ##
  1. Easy language to learn
  1. Fairly simple to make HTML/CSS interfaces that look good and are easy to change
  1. Allows users to interact with each other
  1. Simple enough to be done in 10 weeks
  1. Lots of tools available
    1. PHP Unit for unit testing
    1. Doctrine - ORM for PHP
## Cons ##
  1. Requires setup of Apache/PHP/Database on the developer's machine
  1. Need a way for users to 'upload' their collection details to the website
    1. Being a website we have no access to the user's hard drive so we cannot scan it from the website.  So we will have to devise a plan to get music information from the user's hard drive up to the website.  We could create a program in Java/Python to do this.  -- We should think about this a lot.

# Application #
Stand alone application developed in Java
## Pros ##
  1. If done in Java it is very similar to C/C++ which all of us know
  1. Does not require installation of a web server
  1. We have less constraints than with web applications
    1. Meaning we can access the user's hard drive directly to import music
  1. Tons of tools available
    1. Famous JUnit for unit testing
    1. Hibernate - ORM
    1. Eclipse IDE

## Cons ##
  1. Java GUI programs are a pain in the but to develop - and even harder to customized compared to doing HTML/CSS
  1. User's won't be able to interact with each other
  1. Depending on fast we create the GUI it could take longer than 10 weeks
