We will be using all F/OSS software so there is no cost there, however, in order to host the project we will need to purchase the following
  * Domain Name - $10/year
  * Hosting Services - $5.95/month

# Staffing Costs #
  * Hourly Rate: $25
  * Retainer Fee: $500

With four people working 8 hours per week for 11 weeks the cost in salaries would be $8800.  Then for a year of hosting service/domain name it would be $81.40 coming to a total of $9381.40 for our services.
